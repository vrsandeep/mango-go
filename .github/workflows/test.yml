    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Go environment
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:

      # Step 3: Install system dependencies required for testing
      # go-sqlite3 requires the SQLite3 library (and gcc), which is not installed on the
      # default runner. The tests also require the migrate CLI tool.
      - name: Install dependencies
